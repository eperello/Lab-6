- **1b.**
- With random shuffling of list: The fixed pivot quicksort had runtimes of .002 or less for all values of n. The random pivot quicksort had runtimes that increased as n increased and got to 0.006 at its highest.
- With no random shuffling of lists: The fixed pivot quicksort had runtimes of .002 or less and the runtimes were smaller overall than with random shuffling. The random pivot quicksort had fairly random runtimes as n increased with the highest value being 0.007 for n=100.




- **1c.**
- The 'sorted' function had fast runtimes when n is small, but gets up to 1.899 when n=100000.
